# 👋 Hello, I'm Jacob Dufosse!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about exploring the realms of technology, creativity, and well-being. Here's a little bit about me:

- 👀 My Interests: I'm captivated by the worlds of Python programming, cybersecurity, and machine learning. I believe in the power of technology to shape our future and make the digital landscape more secure and intelligent.

- 🌱 What I'm Learning: Currently, I'm delving into intermediate Python, dipping my toes into the realm of beginner C++, diving into networking intricacies, and exploring the depths of operating systems.

- 💞️ Collaboration and Projects(open-source): While I'm relatively new to the tech world (it's a come back, see the fun facts below), I'm eager to apply my current skills and learn alongside others. I'm excited to contribute in any way I can to projects related to python programming, cybersecurity, hacking, and machine learning. 

- 📫 How to Reach Me: Feel free to connect with me via email at j.dufosse.professionnel@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussions, project ideas, and networking.

- 🎉 Fun Fact: My journey through knowledge has taken some intriguing twists! I originally studied microelectronics engineering at the tender age of 2 (yes, you read that right!). But life's journey led me down different paths. For a decade, I immersed myself in graphic design and crafting interactive installations. Afterward, I found my center as a yoga teacher and breathing coach, both online and at my yoga school on the beautiful Reunion Island. I even embraced social media, amassing over 5000 followers on Facebook as a micro-influencer focusing on breathing techniques and stress management.

-✨ Philosophical Outlook: I hold a steadfast belief that our world should stand on the pillars of fairness, where everyone is subject to the same rules and regulations, irrespective of their background or financial standing. I stand against the notion that money should solely dictate the course of our existence. Instead, I envision a world where communities are strengthened, equality prevails, and safety is paramount—free from the influence of profit-driven agendas. If there's an opportunity for me to play a role in building this vision, count me in. Let's work together to create a future that's defined by unity, fairness, and security.
Feel free to explore my repositories, connect with me, and join me on this exciting journey of exploration, learning, and creation.
